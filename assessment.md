# BIO6500 - Special Topics in Bioinformatics - Assessment (Fall 2023)

## Instructor: Asscociate Prof. [Vasilis J Promponas](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/dir/el/component/comprofiler/userprofile/vprobon). [vprobon@ucy.ac.cy](mailto:vprobon@ucy.ac.cy)

The final class grade results using several different assessment criteria, as follows:

|Assessment criteria|					Weight|
|---|---|
|Attendance/Participation (AP)|5%|
|Homework		(HW)|				15%|
|Seminar		(SE)|				20%|
|Midterm Exam	(ME)|				20%|
|Final Exam		(FE)|				40%|

**Final Grade = 0.05\*AP + 0.15\*HW + 0.2*SE + 0.2\*ME +0.4\*FE**


An alternative path (after approval of the instructor) includes pursuing an independent **Computer Programming/Data Analysis project (PR)**, which can be assessed up to 40% of the total class grade (based on the additional workload of the assignment). 

In this case, the final grade is computed as

**Final Grade = x\*PR + (1-x) \* (0.05\*AP + 0.15\*HW + 0.2*SE + 0.2\*ME +0.4\*FE)**

where **x** corresponds to the weight of the independent project that will be decided between individual students and the instructor, based on the workload of the assigned project.
