### Assignment 2 - On "Genome Aware" methods for gene/protein function prediction


#### Background information
The readings, material and discussions we had in class on "Phylogenetic Profiles"-, "Gene Neighborhood"- and "Gene Fusion"-based methods.

#### Tasks
1. Choose a published, peer-reviewed research paper which predicts some aspect of gene/protein function using at least one of the "Genome aware" methods. 
2. Write a short summary (max. 1500 words) describing:
   a. Which was the biological question the authors tried to address in this paper?
   b. What data (mention data type/types, sources, size and any aother features you consider important) did the authors use?
   c. Which were the main methodological steps they followed?

In your report ensure you
1. Explain which steps you followed to find the particular paper.
2. You may want to critically comment on points a-c above.
